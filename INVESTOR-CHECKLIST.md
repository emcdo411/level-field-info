A modern, founder-friendly summary of **202 Questions Investors Ask Before Investing in a Startup** (Cowtown Angels).

## TL;DR (Too Long; Didn’t Read)  

Investors want to know if your startup has **a real opportunity, a smart plan, a capable team, and a clear path to financial success.**  

Key due diligence themes:  
- **Opportunity** → Market size, growth potential, and differentiators. Why *you*? Why now?  
- **Sales & Marketing** → How you’ll acquire, keep, and grow customers. CAC, strategy, and scalability.  
- **Competition** → Who else is out there, barriers to entry, and your edge.  
- **Technology** → Uniqueness, defensibility (IP), maturity, and risks.  
- **Financials** → Current runway, burn, forecasts, capital access plan, and exit strategy.  
- **Legal/Structure** → Compliance, IP ownership, governance, and litigation risks.  
- **Management** → Team honesty, resilience, passion, and proven ability to execute.  
- **The Deal** → Valuation, terms, expected return, and investor protections.  

**Big takeaway:** It’s not just about your product. It’s about whether the *entire company* is structured and led in a way that makes investors confident they’ll see a return.

## TL;DW (Too Long; Didn’t Watch)  

**If you want funding, be ready to answer:**  
1. What problem are you solving, for whom, and how big is the market?  
2. Why are you uniquely positioned to win against competition?  
3. How will you acquire and keep customers cost-effectively?  
4. What’s special (and protected) about your tech or approach?  
5. How are you managing your cash and what’s the path to exit?  
6. Is your company legally clean and investment-ready?  
7. Can your team actually execute under pressure?  
8. What’s the deal investors are really getting (valuation, terms, ROI)?  

**Investor mindset:** Angels and VCs back people as much as products. They’ll probe until they trust that your vision, plan, and execution can turn opportunity into profit.
